    "### What is a Jupyter Notebook?\n",
    "A Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It's a great tool for data analysis, scientific research, and learning to code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Cells\n",
    "There are mainly two types of cells in Jupyter Notebooks:\n",
    "1. **Code cells**: These cells contain code that can be executed.\n",
    "2. **Markdown cells**: These cells contain text formatted using Markdown, a lightweight markup language that allows you to format the text in various ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating and Running Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Creating a Code Cell**: To create a new code cell, click on the \"+\" button in the toolbar or use the keyboard shortcut `B` to insert a cell below the current cell. Type your code in the new cell and press `Shift + Enter` to run it.\n",
    "- **Creating a Markdown Cell**: To create a markdown cell, first create a new cell as above, then use the keyboard shortcut `M` to change a cell to markdown. Type your text using Markdown syntax and press `Shift + Enter` to render it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding Cells Above and Below\n",
    "- **Add Cell Below**: Click the \"+\" button in the toolbar or press `B`.\n",
    "- **Add Cell Above**: Press `A`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Markdown?\n",
    "Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Markdown is used to format text in Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some basic Markdown examples:\n",
    "- **Headings**: Create headings by starting a line with one (for H1), two (for H2), or more `#` characters, followed by a space.\n",
    "- **Bold and Italics**: Use `**` or `__` for **bold** text and `*` or `_` for *italic* text.\n",
    "- **Lists**: Create bullet lists using `*`, `+`, or `-`, followed by a space. Create numbered lists using numbers followed by a period.\n",
    "- **Links**: Create links using `[link text](URL)`."
